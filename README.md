# *SpaceMath* - A Mathematical Notation System & LaTeX Translator 

#### The aim with SpaceMath is to make the *simplest system possible for people to enter (displayable) math into a computer*

Spacemath solves the lack of a fast and convenient method for inserting mathematical notation in documents. LaTeX, the current most widely used system is cumbersome and difficult to type and remember, while GUIs are too slow and inefficient for longer input. Spacemath is also compatible with screen readers, unlike LaTeX, and has international support (you can type in Chinese!). Spacemath is backwards compatible with both LaTeX and Asciimath. Implemented for David Farmer at the American Institue of Mathematics.

## The SpaceMath philosophy:
- Don’t force the author to write what they don’t need to
- You shouldn't have to consult a manual to figure out how to type a mathematical expression
- Accessibility and internationalization should be built in from the start
